Quick play around with a fresh PyCharm community install

Following the Flask tutorial from :- 
https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-flask-a-python-microframework

Tutorial completed which gave me the basic site functionality.

Now can be used as a sandpit to play with other ideas.


Added a random number generator to test page refreshes. This is a trial for a different project I'll be working on

Note to self: Don't forget to run "export FLASK_APP=run.py" in order to be able to run via "flask run"
